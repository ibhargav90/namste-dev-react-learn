## Content Delivery Network (CDN) - Explained

Have you ever visited a website that loads too slowly because the files (like pictures and videos) take too long to load? That's where a Content Delivery Network (CDN) comes in.

To understand how it works, imagine you want to give a candy to your friend who lives far away from you. But you don't want to go all the way there yourself because it's too far and will take a lot of time. So, you can ask your other friends who live closer to your friend to help you deliver the candy. They can take the candy from you and bring it to your friend quickly.

A CDN works in a similar way. When you visit a website, the website's files are stored in a server located in a faraway place. This can slow down the website's loading time. However, a CDN has many servers located in different places around the world. When you visit the website, the CDN helps deliver the files from a server that's closest to you. This way, the website can load faster, and you don't have to wait as long.

## crossorigin Attribute in HTML - Explained

Sometimes, webpages use files (like images or fonts) that are hosted on different websites. To use these files, the webpage needs permission from that website first. The crossorigin attribute in HTML helps the webpage ask for permission.

For instance, imagine you have a toy that you want to share with your friend. But your mom says that you can only share the toy if your friend's mom gives permission first. This is kind of like what the crossorigin attribute does. If a webpage wants to use a file hosted on a different website, it can add the crossorigin attribute to the appropriate tag. When the file loads, the browser sends a message to the other website asking for permission to use the file. If the other website approves, the file will load on the webpage. But if the other website denies permission, then the browser won't show the file. This helps keep things safe and fair on the internet.

## async and defer Attributes in HTML - Explained

When a webpage loads, it needs to download all the files associated with that page, including the scripts that make the page interactive. By default, the browser loads and executes each script in the order they appear in the HTML code, which can slow down the page. The async and defer attributes help optimize the performance of webpages by telling the browser how to load and execute scripts.

Here's an easy way to understand how async and defer work:

Imagine you have many toys to play with, and your friends are coming over to play. But some of your friends arrive earlier than others. To start playing with your toys as soon as possible, you can tell your friends who arrived early to start playing with the toys first. This way, you don't have to wait for all your friends to arrive before you can start playing.

The async attribute tells the browser to load and execute the script independently of the rest of the page. This can make the page load faster, but it also means that the script might not be able to access other parts of the page until they are fully loaded.

On the other hand, the defer attribute tells the browser to load the script in the background while the rest of the page is loading but not to execute it until the entire page has finished loading. This can also speed up the page load time, and because the script is executed in order, it can access other parts of the page as needed.

In general, use async when the script doesn't depend on other parts of the page and can be executed independently. Use defer when the script needs to be executed in order and depends
